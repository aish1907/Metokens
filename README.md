# Metokens
Me-token is an application powered by ERC-20 smart contracts and azure maps that helps bring 
social inclusion in this hard time of pandemic and ledger accurate data of the situation 
to reduce the on-going chaos and panic amongst people. 
I have created a system  that would help the hospitals and the government to keep track of the 
people who have contracted contagious diseases with the help of tokens issued by lawful authorities.
This would stop useless travel and help prevent further spread of such diseases. This system 
signitficantly brings in transparency to the entire centralized system with visualization 
addded by azure maps which helps reduce panic amongst people due to fake news spread. Along
 with the benefit of e-pass it allows people to tokenize their medical records for easy and
 controlled access to the lawful insitutions in just few clicks.The dissemination of these 
tokens draws an analogy with the tangible coins only that if they are minted by you, 
you are the sole owner of it throughout its lifecycle, and you can tranfer 
or withdraw it from the arbitrary owner at any point of time. The token acts as a key
 to your medical record that is encrypted and stored in the ipfs and can only be viewed 
by the owner of it. This would help prevent unauthorized selling of your medical data by hospitals or hackers.
This makes the owner the sole master of his health data as governed by the smart contracts.
